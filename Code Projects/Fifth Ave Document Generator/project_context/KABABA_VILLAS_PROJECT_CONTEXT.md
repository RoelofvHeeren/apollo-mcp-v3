---

## Risk Mitigation

### Deposit-First, Conditional Execution
- Deposit already placed on land
- 90-day pre-sales window before full land payment
- Validates market demand before full capital deployment

### Land Flip Optionality
If pre-sales traction is slower than expected:
- Land can be resold (flipped) at profit due to:
  - Strategic location
  - Clean zoning
  - Rising demand in Kaba-Kaba/Buduk corridor
- Creates **hard downside floor** limiting capital risk

### Pre-Sales = Equity Funding
- Pre-sales fund remaining equity requirement
- Reduces external capital risk
- Lowers investor exposure
- Improves return efficiency
