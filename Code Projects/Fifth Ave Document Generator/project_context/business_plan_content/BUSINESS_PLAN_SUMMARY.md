# Business Plan — Kaba Kaba Villa Development

*Developer:* Fifth Avenue Properties
*Location:* Kaba Kaba, Bali
*Project Size:* 20 Villas | 25-Year Leasehold

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Kaba Kaba Villa Development is a *sales-led, risk-controlled residential project* structured to prioritise *capital preservation first, followed by **high-probability upside* through off-plan execution.

Unlike traditional speculative developments, this project has been deliberately designed so that *full capital deployment only occurs once real market demand is proven*. A deposit-first land structure, combined with a 90-day pre-sales validation window and a proven off-plan sales engine, significantly reduces downside risk while preserving strong return potential.

*Target outcomes:*

•⁠  ⁠Capital cycle: ~20 months
•⁠  ⁠Annualised IRR: ~32.2%
•⁠  ⁠Upside through price escalation as pre-sales accelerate

---

## 2. Land Acquisition & Risk Mitigation Strategy

(Primary Strength of the Deal)

### Deposit-First, Conditional Land Execution

A deposit has already been placed on the land, securing exclusivity while allowing *90 days to achieve targeted pre-sales* before the balance of the land payment is due.

This structure:

•⁠  ⁠Validates real buyer demand *before* full capital commitment
•⁠  ⁠Avoids speculative land exposure
•⁠  ⁠Preserves capital flexibility at the earliest stage

This approach fundamentally *reverses the traditional development risk profile*.

Instead of:

	⁠Buy land → build → hope to sell

The project follows:

	⁠Secure land → prove demand → proceed

---

### Downside Protection & Capital Safety

If pre-sales do *not* meet expectations within the 90-day window:

•⁠  ⁠The project *does not proceed*
•⁠  ⁠The land can be *resold (flipped)* at a profit due to:

  * Location within the emerging Buduk / Kaba Kaba corridor
  * Increasing developer and buyer activity in this submarket
  * Clean zoning and development-ready status
•⁠  ⁠*All invested capital can be returned*, rather than being tied up in construction or inventory

This creates a *hard downside floor*. Capital is not exposed to:

•⁠  ⁠Construction risk
•⁠  ⁠Market absorption risk
•⁠  ⁠Long-dated execution risk

until sales have already validated the pricing.

This is a materially lower-risk structure compared to conventional Bali developments.

---

## 3. Developer & Execution Capability

### Fifth Avenue Properties — Developer & Sales Execution

Fifth Avenue Properties is the lead developer and brings:

•⁠  ⁠A *fully in-house marketing department*
•⁠  ⁠A *systemised off-plan sales infrastructure*
•⁠  ⁠International buyer reach
•⁠  ⁠Repeatable execution across comparable developments

This is not a first-time or opportunistic developer — the project is being executed by a team with *proven systems*, not ad-hoc sales efforts.

---

### Construction & Comparable Sales Proof

The contractor team behind this project has:

•⁠  ⁠Delivered comparable villas in the same market
•⁠  ⁠Recently sold *two villas off-plan at approximately USD $350,000 each* in the immediate area
•⁠  ⁠Demonstrated strong buyer acceptance for off-plan product at this price level

These *$350,000 off-plan sales* provide direct market validation that:

•⁠  ⁠Buyers are comfortable committing early
•⁠  ⁠Pricing assumptions are realistic
•⁠  ⁠Off-plan execution risk is materially reduced

The view is that this project can *meet or exceed* those results through stronger marketing and a more structured sales funnel.

---

## 4. Sales Strategy & Execution Plan

(Second Core Strength of the Deal)

### Sales Philosophy

The sales strategy is built around:

•⁠  ⁠*Velocity first*
•⁠  ⁠*Margin optimisation second*

Early pricing is intentionally conservative to:

•⁠  ⁠Drive fast absorption
•⁠  ⁠Validate demand
•⁠  ⁠Fund equity requirements through pre-sales

Once momentum is established, pricing is adjusted upward to maximise returns.

---

### Lead Generation & Marketing

Fifth Avenue’s in-house marketing team will deploy:

•⁠  ⁠Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram)
•⁠  ⁠High-conversion Video Sales Letters (VSLs)
•⁠  ⁠Targeted international lifestyle-investor campaigns

These systems are already live and tested across other projects.

---

### Sales Process (Systemised & Measurable)

1.⁠ ⁠Inbound lead generated
2.⁠ ⁠*Contact within 60 seconds* by trained appointment setters
3.⁠ ⁠Immediate qualification to filter serious buyers
4.⁠ ⁠Qualified prospects booked directly into calls with experienced closers
5.⁠ ⁠Closers focus exclusively on conversion

This separation of marketing, qualification, and closing significantly improves conversion rates and reduces lead leakage.

---

### Pre-Sales Targets & Phasing

| Phase   | Timeline   | Target      | Purpose             |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Phase 1 | Days 1–30  | 25–30% sold | Demand validation   |
| Phase 2 | Days 31–60 | 20–25% sold | Equity coverage     |
| Phase 3 | Days 61–90 | 10–15% sold | Margin optimisation |

*Target pre-sales:* ~60–65% before full land payment

This aligns with best-practice off-plan development thresholds.

---

### Sales Risk Controls

If sales velocity underperforms:

•⁠  ⁠Pricing incentives can be selectively applied
•⁠  ⁠Marketing spend can be reallocated to highest-converting channels
•⁠  ⁠Unit mix emphasis can be shifted toward fastest-selling layouts
•⁠  ⁠The land flip option remains available prior to final land payment

Sales risk is *actively managed*, not passively accepted.

---

## 5. Buyer Profile & Demand Justification

### Ideal Client Profile

The project is designed for Bali’s strongest demand segment:

•⁠  ⁠Families seeking a second home
•⁠  ⁠Entrepreneurs and remote business owners
•⁠  ⁠Lifestyle investors combining personal use with rental income

---

### “Live + Earn” Ownership Model

Post-COVID buyer behaviour strongly favours:

•⁠  ⁠Flexible ownership
•⁠  ⁠Part-time use
•⁠  ⁠Professionally managed rentals during non-occupancy
•⁠  ⁠Cash-flow-positive lifestyle assets

This buyer group is:

•⁠  ⁠Less speculative
•⁠  ⁠More decisive
•⁠  ⁠Comfortable with off-plan purchases when the developer and sales team are credible

This is exactly the demographic Fifth Avenue has consistently sold to.

---

## 6. Pre-Sales as Capital Strategy

Pre-sales are used to:

•⁠  ⁠Fund the majority of required equity
•⁠  ⁠Reduce external capital exposure
•⁠  ⁠Improve IRR efficiency
•⁠  ⁠Lower overall project risk

This ensures investor capital is deployed *only once demand is proven*.

---

## 7. Financial Performance Summary

*Base Case:*

•⁠  ⁠Capital cycle: ~20 months
•⁠  ⁠Annualised IRR: ~32.2%
•⁠  ⁠Strong margin buffer

*Upside Case:*

•⁠  ⁠Price increases as pre-sales accelerate
•⁠  ⁠Improved net profit and IRR
•⁠  ⁠Earlier capital recovery

Returns are driven by *sales execution and capital efficiency*, not leverage or speculation.

---

## 8. Why This Project Works (Investor Perspective)

1.⁠ ⁠*Exceptional Risk Mitigation*
   Deposit-first land structure with flip optionality

2.⁠ ⁠*Proven Off-Plan Sales Capability*
   $350k off-plan sales already achieved nearby

3.⁠ ⁠*Sales-Led Execution*
   Demand proven before full commitment

4.⁠ ⁠*Aligned Buyer Demand*
   Lifestyle + income model matches real market behaviour

5.⁠ ⁠*Multiple Exit Paths*
   Build and sell, price escalation, or land flip

---

## Final Conclusion

This project is not speculative development.
It is a *controlled, demand-validated execution strategy* designed to ensure:

•⁠  ⁠Capital is protected first
•⁠  ⁠Sales are proven early
•⁠  ⁠Upside is unlocked only after risk is removed

This is how disciplined real estate development should be structured.
